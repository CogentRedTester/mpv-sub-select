# Forcibly enable the script regardless of the sid option
force_enable=no

# Selects subtitles synchronously during the preloaded hook, which has better
# compatability with other scripts and options.
# This requires that the script predict what the default audio track will be,
# so theoretically this can be wrong on some rare occasions.
# Disabling this will switch the subtitle track after playback starts.
preload=yes

# Experimental audio track selection based on the preference json file.
# This overrides `force_prediction` and `detect_incorrect_predictions`.
select_audio=no

# Remove any potential prediction failures by forcibly selecting whichever
# audio track was predicted
force_prediction=no

# Detect when a prediction is wrong and re-check the subtitles
# this is automatically disabled if `force_prediction` is enabled.
detect_incorrect_predictions=yes

# Observe audio switches and reselect the subtitles when alang changes
observe_audio_switches=no

# Only select forced subtitles if they are explicitly stated in slang.
# By default, when searching for subtitle tracks with a specific language,
# forced subtitles will be included in the search results and treated the same as other tracks.
# This means that there's no way to write a rule that specifically excludes
# forced subtitle tracks. By enabling this forced subtitles will never be chosen unless a rule
# explicitly includes "forced" in `slang`.
explicit_forced_subs=no

# Set the folder that contains the 'sub-select.json' file
