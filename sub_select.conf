# Only select forced subtitles if they are explicitly stated in slang.
# By default, when searching for subtitle tracks with a specific language,
# forced subtitles will be included in the search results and treated the same as other tracks.
# This means that there's no way to write a rule that specifically excludes
# forced subtitle tracks. By enabling this forced subtitles will never be chosen unless a rule
# explicitly includes "forced" in `slang`.
